How is your imagination today? While __classic__ lego bricks allow for very detailed builds that resemble reality quite closely, __*Duplo*__
pieces are bigger, easier to handle especially by smaller kids, but require much more imagination to see what was actually built. For years now the main theme in our house are Tobots- if you don't have young kids, you probably don't know what they are... And my kid just loves to build variations of them
